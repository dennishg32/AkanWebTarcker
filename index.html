                Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names. GOAL The goal of this week's Independent Project
                is to help us practice and better understand the concepts that we have covered throughout this week. These include working with data types, Array, writing functions, control flow, and operators. Overall Description For this week's Independent
                Project, you will be required to build a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.
